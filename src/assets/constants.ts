  Arcologies:{name: 'Arcologies',description:" Cities have been forged into massive, self-contained arcologies with little need for the outside world beyond resource-gathering outposts. Outside of the arcologies, massive stretches of now-abandoned urban areas and desperate favelas occupy the former city footprint. To live outside an arcology is to be a dangerous outlaw."},
  Balkanization:{name: 'Balkanization',description:" The present-day superpowers have effectively collapsed, with no plausible heirs to impose a global order. The entire world is a patchwork of ethnic and religious groups broken down into microstates and splinter areas, many of whom nurse powerful grudges against their neighbors. There is little or no international coordination beyond the efforts of multinational megacorps, and international rules are whatever the corporations say they are."},
  CasteFormation:{name: 'Caste Formation',description:" An international elite of hereditary megacorp families has formed a new caste of rulers and oligarchs. Lesser breeds can only hope to attach themselves to some powerful dynasty and reap the rewards of loyal service. People take it as a commonplace that these elites are smarter, better, and wiser than ordinary people, a state perhaps justified by cyberware or gengineering."},
  ClimateChange:{name: 'Climate Change',description:" Large portions of the world are now substantially hotter, colder, wetter, drier, or are otherwise different from how they are at present. This outcome may have derived from human activity, solar perturbations, meteor strikes, interstellar dust clouds, or the nebulous work of unfathomable forces. Some areas of the planet are now largely uninhabitable due to the hostile conditions, and large numbers of people have been forced to move to find more tolerable surroundings. Portions of the coast may be inundated, while in colder cycles there may be new lands exposed by receding sea levels."},
  ClassWarfate:{name: 'Class Warfare',description:" Numerous national revolutions cropped up around the globe. The details and ideologies varied, but they largely boiled down to revolts of the impoverished against the powerful. The powerful were utterly victorious, crushing all institutions and organizations they did not control and cementing their dominance over virtually all material means of survival and success. Bitter remnants still fight a losing battle."},
  CromeCultists:{name: 'Chrome Cultists',description:" Some group or social class embraced cyber and genetic manipulation to an extreme extent as an ideological position. They may have been unjustly hated and feared by the less-augmented, or they could have envisioned themselves as the naturally-superior rulers of lesser humanity. In either case, the conflict produced global chaos before the cultists were destroyed or driven underground. Heavy modern users of cyber are likely suspected of cult allegiance, but the tech is too ingrained to reject entirely."},
  Despair:{name: 'Despair',description:" Global society has largely given in to nihilism, despair, and hopelessness. The universal craving is for distraction and numbing pleasures, occasionally punctuated by furious dedication to some deranged cause that might give a person's life meaning. Birth rates have plummeted, populations have shrunk, and people now struggle over their share of an ever-shrinking economy."},
  Disconnection:{name: 'Disconnection',description:" Nations, regions, and cities have turned inward and largely sought to cut off contacts with other polities, the better to control the diffusion of dangerous facts and ideas. The only wide-scale communication exists at the corporate level and well-controlled government communication lines. Citizens of a particular region are discouraged from travel and permitted to learn only what their betters want them to learn of other places. The outside world is dangerous; only the authorities can be trusted to interact with it."},
  Empire:{name: 'Empire',description:" One nation or polity has succeeded in crushing all its significant rivals. The only nations that exist are those directly subordinate to the superpower and those too impoverished and isolated to be worth vassalizing. The world's megacorps are constantly fighting to control the superpower's government, and different corps may have mutually-hostile grips on different departments or regions of the polity."},
  Famine:{name: 'Famine',description:" A massive shortage of basic food staples has been created by crop diseases, climate change, industrial pollution, or overpopulation. Much of the world's land area is no longer usable for crops, and polities struggle to control fertile zones in order to feed their people. Hunger is a basic fact of life for anyone below the middle class."},
  Mutation:{name: 'Mutation',description:" Industrial toxins, poorly-tested cyberware, experimental gene therapy, or unsafe pharmaceuticals have produced large numbers of mutated humans or wildlife. Most of these mutations are harmful in nature, requiring cybernetic prostheses to mitigate them, though some might unexpectedly improve the victim. Many mutants may be forced to work for whatever organization can support their critically-important medical cyber."},
  NaturalDisaster:{name: 'Natural Disaster',description:" A global-scale natural catastrophe scourged the planet. A meteor strike, super-volcano eruption, atmospheric composition disturbance, or other vast calamity destroyed humanity over a considerable portion of the planet and forced the survivors into far more restricted areas. At least one generation was forced to concern itself with bare survival at all costs."},
  Plague:{name: 'Plague',description:" One or more global pandemics have culled humanity, with a substantial percentage of the population dying off. Reservoirs of the sickness may still persist in isolated areas, and repeated waves of lesser virulence may still strike cities. Some particularly hard-hit regions of the globe may have been largely depopulated, and might remain uninhabitable if the disease has found some natural animal host there."},
  PopulationFlux:{name: 'Population Flux',description:" The world is either drastically overpopulated or extremely underpopulated. There may have been a dramatic upswing in population growth after corporate and governmental efforts, leading to a world of packed arcologies and seaboard-wide megaplexes, or a combination of disasters and despair may have left the world all but empty except for a few remaining population centers and the megacorps who fight over their human debris."},
  ResourceShortage:{name: 'Resource Shortage',description:" One or more critical resources, such as petroleum, rare earths, copper, or other material has run short either through over-exploitation or some new, disastrous natural reaction with modern atmospheric pollutants. Control of the remaining sources of this material is a common prize in megacorp struggles, and ordinary people have been forced to learn how to do without many things dependent on the substance."},
  ReligiousRevival:{name: 'Religious Revival',description:" One or more religions or ideologies have caught fire in the recent past, experiencing tremendous growth in adherents and general fervor. These may be old religions given new relevance by present hardships, or some new faith built to appeal to the current public. Numerous conflicts have erupted in areas where the new faith has collided with old, traditional beliefs."},
  SpaceExodus:{name: 'Space Exodus',description:" A chunk of humanity has left Earth for points further out in the solar system. There may be colonies on the moon, outposts on Mars, or vast orbital habitats to serve as sanctuaries for the rich and powerful. Earth is heavily exploited for its pool of human labor and the few resources that are more copious there than in the asteroid belt."},
  ToxicWastes:{name: 'Toxic Wastes',description:" Industrial production has resulted in the creation of massive toxic zones on land and sea, where life is either impossible or terribly changed. Former inhabitants of these areas have either died or fled into exile, and many nations have suffered serious civil strife due to the chaos created by the pollution. Whatever kind of toxin it was, it was probably subtle enough that no one realized the consequences until it was widespread."},
  Urbanization:{name: 'Urbanization',description:" Both governments and megacorps agree on the utility of compacting their subjects and consumers into more easily-controlled urban centers. In the past decade, rural and small city populations have been “encouraged” to move into corp-controlled cities, to the point that there are vast swaths of land occupied only by corporate farms and returning wilderness."},
  Warfate:{name: 'Warfare',description:" At least one global conflict has erupted within living memory, possibly with a nuclear exchange. The conflict may have derived from the death throes of a superpower, a regional conflict that escalated out of control, or the clash of puppet governments serving the wills of quarreling megacorps."},

  Anarchy:{name: 'Anarchy', description:"The region has spent some time in a state of ungoverned lawlessness, a condition that might still persist. Local authority rests with those who can provide resources or who can bring violent force to bear. Numerous would-be governmental groups fought to lay claim to the area, and very harsh arrangements might be tolerated so long as they bring a modicum of social order to people's lives."},
  Awakening:{name: 'Awakening',description:" A great ideal, cause, or religion caught fire in the region, inspiring large numbers of people to follow it even at great personal cost. At least one major social institution was born of this awakening, and it still might hold substantial power even if the initial fervor has since died away."},
  BorderLockdown:{name: 'Border Lockdown', description:" The region had some reason to tightly seal its borders, preventing people from entering or exiting without the right connections or governmental passes. It may have perceived some special threat from outsiders, or it was so miserable that its inhabitants had to be imprisoned to keep them from fleeing. The physical walls, minefields, and monitoring stations that kept the border tight probably still exist."},
  BubbleEconomy:{name: 'Bubble Economy', description:" The region had something that was extremely valuable until it wasn't. Vast wealth was followed by a vaster crash, and the dilapidated remnants of former glory still litter the place."},
  BoomingEconomy:{name: 'Booming Economy', description:"This area was lucky in the recent past, and provided some resource or industrial center that brought in tremendous wealth. Most of it went to the megacorps and the elites, but enough of it trickled down to leave some impressive monuments in its wake."},
  CityCollapse:{name: 'City Collapse', description:" The city or region collapsed utterly in the recent past, becoming largely uninhabitable for most of its then-inhabitants. It may have been the result of some natural disaster, a terrible famine, a ferocious war, or some other disaster that has only slowly abated in the years since."},
  CivilWar:{name: 'Civil War', description:" The region was split between two or more mutually-hostile governments, each determined to crush all opposition. They may have splintered along ideological lines, ethnic faults, or corporate allegiances, but the destruction was calamitous. One of the sides may have won a convincing victory, or they may have simply fought each other to a mutually-exhausted stalemate."},
  Clearances:{name: 'Clearances', description:" Significant portions of the region were methodically purged of inhabitants in order to satisfy the needs of the government or megacorps. The land they occupied may have been more valuable to corporate owners, they might have been persistent troublemakers to their rulers, or natural hazards may have been so severe that they had no choice but to leave. Their heirs likely still suffer the consequences of their losses, and may not be overly welcome in the places they now live."},
  ClimateChange:{name: 'Climate Change', description:" Whether the world as a whole has changed or not, this region certainly has. Local conditions have become severe, with drought, heat, cold, or sea level changes provoking serious problems to the inhabitants. There are probably still remnants buildings and communities that existed during the former, more clement period, now abandoned by all but the most desperate hangers-on."},
  CorpNationalization:{name: 'Corp Nationalization', description:" The local government nationalized a megacorp in the region, turning it into a direct arm of the local authorities. Conversely, the corp may have effectively taken over the local government from the inside, making its “private” branch no more than a subsidized agency of the state. If the megacorp exists elsewhere as well, those branches may be bitter toward their “stolen” or “traitorous” fellow corpers."},
  CorporateCollapse:{name: 'Corporate Collapse', description:" A megacorp that was crucial to the economy of the region collapsed sometime in the recent past, dragging scores of local businesses down with it. It may have been the fruit of corporate error, hostile outside attacks, or a parent corporation deciding that the place simply wasn't worth the investment. Hollowed-out remnants of the corp's buildings and factories likely still litter the region."},
  DeathSquads:{name: 'Death Squads', description:" A political, religious, or corporate war was fought here under the cover of night, with death squads and other militant groups making efforts to murder specific opponents of their backers. Certain political views or corporate affiliations were enough to get people disappeared, and the leaders of these death squads may have since moved on to positions of governmental or corporate importance."},
  DynasticRulers:{name: 'Dynastic Rulers', description:" The leadership of the region is tightly controlled by a particular family, with all the most important positions going to scions of the blood. This family may exist in considerable tension with the government or megacorp they supposedly represent, their local influence a degree of power that their supposed superiors would rather they not have."},
  FailedInvasion:{name: 'Failed Invasion', description:" Either the region tried to invade a neighbor or was invaded by an outside power. In either case, the effort was a failure, with the would-be conquerers either absorbed, ejected, or left to flounder in persistent failure. The resentment and bitterness between those involved has left numerous scars on the region."},
  Immigrants:{name: 'Immigrants', description:" The region experienced a major flux of immigrants from another area, ones attracted by its relative prosperity or forced to flee their former home by some calamity there. The locals are unlikely to have welcomed the new competition for regional resources and influence, and these immigrants may still be bubbled into ghettos and ethnic zones where they must make do as best they can."},
  IndustrialSpill:{name: 'Industrial Spill', description:" A large-scale industrial accident caused grave damage in the region, a calamity that still exerts a presence in current affairs. There may be valuable salvage left in the contaminated zone, or refugees may still be a problem in neighboring areas, or resentment over the accident may still be causing reprisals and violence among those affected."},
  IneptRulers:{name: 'Inept Rulers', description:" The leaders of the region made some extremely bad choices, either out of self-interest or sheer incompetence. When facing some problem, they likely made the worst possible choice in how to deal with it, and now the present-day inhabitants have to deal with the consequences of their ineptitude."},
  InfrastructureCollapse:{name: 'Infrastructure Collapse', description:" Whether water, power, transport, public security, or some other critical component of modern life, the region has suffered a severe lack of it. Natural resources may have been exhausted, megacorp manipulation may have ruined it, or it may have been taken over by renegade elements. Even now, most people need to make a considerable effort to get access to this necessity rather than counting on it to be available."},
  InternalMigration:{name: 'Internal Migration', description:" Natives from one section of the region had to move to another, forced out by necessity or tempted by better prosperity. This migration doubtless caused considerable hostility between the newcomers and the locals, with the local government or megacorps fanning the flames when it proved profitable to their own interests. These migrants may still be second-class citizens within their own homeland."},
  LegalUnderclass:{name: 'Legal Underclass', description:" A particular chunk of the populace lacks the rights that most of natives have. They may be discriminated against due to race, religion, political allegiance, or megacorp employment, but crimes against them are seldom taken seriously and they have little hope of prevailing in any legal suit against a more respected local. It's not uncommon for them to be involved with crime rings or express their discontent through violence and terrorism."},
  MassTerrorism:{name: 'Mass Terrorism', description:" The region was convulsed with a period of mass terrorist attacks by one or more organizations, with large numbers of people killed through bombs, chemical warfare, biological agents, massacres, or other large-scale acts of violence in pursuit of their political goals. The existing government or megacorps were either powerless to stop it or uninterested in doing so, as the outcome of this violence was something profitable to their own interests."},
  MessianicLeader:{name: 'Messianic Leader', description:" A tremendously charismatic leader rose to control the region, marshaling a vast following of zealous adherents who were convinced that their fondest dreams would be made real. If the leader is now dead or gone, their cause has been embodied in some institution or faction determined to carry out their grand plan, regardless of its cost to other locals."},
  NaturalDisaster:{name: 'Natural Disaster', description:" One or more dramatic natural disasters scourged the region, producing enormous loss of life and the destruction of important infrastructure. The locals had to figure out some way around these problems, and many of their solutions involved depriving other, less powerful natives of what they needed to live. The physical consequences of the disaster have still left marks in the region's infrastructure."},
  NewIdentity:{name: 'New Identity', description:" The inhabitants of the region were forced to adopt a new self-identity, perhaps after being annexed by another group, the outlawing of a former religion or institution, or the forcible introduction of outside culture. The adoption of the superseded identities is taken to be a form of rebellion or disloyalty to the region's rulers."},
  NewIndustry:{name: 'New Industry', description:" The region acquired a new industry that has left a substantial mark on the local economy. Many corporations revolve around supporting and expanding this industry, and it's attracted the hostility of outside corps who are competitors."},
  NewUnion:{name: 'New Union', description:" The region was united with another city or polity, whether or not it liked the idea. It may have been the conquering victor of a military action, the unfortunate victim of annexation, or driven into an alliance by some local crisis or dire need. The old power structures struggle to come out as the rulers of the new union, and the losers seek to tear the structure apart."},
  NuclearBlast:{name: 'Nuclear Blast', description:" Someone set off a nuke in the area, either as a terrorist action, an industrial mishap, or a military assault by some nuclear-armed foe. There may still be areas devastated by the destruction and considerable numbers of citizens who bear the scars of the disaster. Valuable resources or territory may be inaccessible in the aftermath."},
  OffensiveWar:{name: 'Offensive War', description:" The region went to war against a neighbor, provoked by their actions or tempted by the prospects of easy pickings. The attack may or may not have been successful, but a generation of locals has been shaped by military service and the privations of wartime life."},
  OldScores:{name: 'Old Scores', description:" Several major groups in the region have grudges to settle against each other. Old crimes, former atrocities, prior betrayals, and other sins have yet to be repaid, though the current situation may force some of these groups to work together to keep the region functioning. They're very likely to hire deniable assets to work out their resentments."},
  Oligarchy:{name: 'Oligarchy', description:" The region is rigidly controlled by an oligarchy of the elite, who shuffle around positions in megacorps and governments without ever allowing new blood into the circle. Lesser officials and vice-executives align themselves with particular oligarchs, and these factions tend to cut across lines of corporate or government organization."},
  OutsideControl:{name: 'Outside Control', description:" The region's government is a puppet controlled by some outside power, one that likely has little or no interest in the wellbeing of the locals. The government may have been infiltrated by corporate agents, suborned by powerful outside influences, or simply so weak that they don't dare oppose the commands of their controllers. Policies are often established that do nothing to benefit the locals but do much to aid the outside authority."},
  Plague:{name: 'Plague', description:" The region was scourged by a severe plague in the recent past, with vast numbers of casualties. Medical services were strained beyond endurance, mass graves were established, and numerous local institutions were gutted by the loss of many important members. There may still be reservoirs of the sickness awaiting a new outbreak."},
  PoliticalSorting:{name: 'Political Sorting', description:" The region has two or more major political groups that have geographically sorted themselves into particular areas or neighborhoods. Belonging to the wrong faction in such areas is hazardous at best, and there are regular illicit raids and reprisals conducted between them over slights real and imagined. If a single government controls multiple areas like this, the battle for control of the top level of governance can be brutal."},
  PopulationCleansing:{name: 'Population Cleansing', description:" A particular religion, ethnicity, corporate affiliation, or nationality has been purged from the city in the recent past, their possessions seized by the local government or native elites. The jobs they did have been left unfilled or occupied by newcomers who may not perform them as well as before. There may still remain pockets of the purged group, and terrorism or violence on their behalf is not unknown."},
  ReligiousPurge:{name: 'Religious Purge', description:" A particular religion or ideology is especially disfavored in the region, and none of its members can expect to be entrusted with any government office or corporate role of any importance, nor are they allowed to inhabit the better social circles. Its believers are often considered disloyal, hostile, and dangerous to the locals. This assessment may be correct for many of the angriest among them."},
  RenegadeMilitary:{name: 'Renegade Military', description:" The region's military forces have gone rogue and have established a state of martial law. The government is now in the hands of military officers, most of whom are obliged to maintain good relations with the regional megacorps if they're to keep their forces operational. In some cases, megacorp military forces or gang militias might be strong enough to take this role."},
  ResourceStrike:{name: 'Resource Strike', description:" A new resource has been found in the region recently, and it's drawn intense interest from local corporations and desperate prospectors. This resource may be a conventional one like oil or gold, or it might be a more abstract thing, like a tremendously vigorous art scene or entrancing new musical genre. The corporations are still fighting over control of its monetization."},
  Revolution:{name: 'Revolution', description:" An ideological revolution recently overturned the government of the region, and a new ruling structure may not have fully coalesced yet out of the surviving insurrectionists. Conversely, a revolution might have been brutally crushed by the authorities, its former leaders now in hiding. In neither case is the actual situation of the city likely to improve measurably."},
  Satrapy:{name: 'Satrapy', description:" The region is a recognized vassal of some larger or more powerful city or polity. Its rulers are allowed to do as they please so long as they provide the requisite amounts of tribute and obedience to their superiors. Different megacorps may be fighting over who is to benefit from the region's submission."},
  Secession:{name: 'Secession', description:" The region split off from its parent polity sometime in the recent past, fighting off attempts to reclaim it or finding an alliance with an overlord powerful enough to protect it from its former rulers. The split may have been caused by political differences, economic concerns, or widespread rejection of some governmental policy. It may also have been provoked by a gang, megacorp, or organization that thought a splinter region would be easier to control."},
  SlaveLabor:{name: 'Slave Labor', description:" The region practices open slavery, though it may not call it that. Slavery may be a penalty for debt, a criminal punishment, or a class condition imposed on a disfavored religion, ethnicity, or national origin; whatever induces it, the local government is at pains to justify it as a fair and reasonable allocation of human resources."},
  StolenProsperity:{name: 'Stolen Prosperity', description:" The region should be much wealthier than it is, but the profit from its industries and local resources are being siphoned off by an outside power. The governmental rulers may be stealing it for their own use, a powerful megacorp may have a stranglehold on its finances, or a military aggressor may be taking it as war debt."},
  Tyranny:{name: 'Tyranny', description:" The region's ruling powers won't leave their subjects alone, and impose numerous humiliating, aggravating, or offensive demands on them for the government's own benefit. The necessity for these demands may be blamed on the threat of a hostile outside power, or the local rulers may simply have clamped down so tight on their subjects that they don't dare loosen their grip lest the hint of freedom ignite an explosion."},
  LocalMilitary:{name: 'Local Military', description:" The region has an exceptionally well-developed military under control of the local government or megacorps. This military was usually developed as a response to events, either to take advantage of a weaker neighbor or to prevent a takeover by some aggressive outside power. The locals likely struggle over control of the military, using it as muscle to pursue their own purposes."},
  CorpWar:{name: 'Corp War', description:" Two or more megacorps had an all-out war in the region at some time in the past, deploying corporate military forces and hired mercenaries to destroy enemy resources and kill their employees. Outside parties may have moved in to crush the weakened corps after they'd bled each other white, or one corp may have finally won a nominal victory and taken control over the debris."},
  CorruptLeaders:{name: 'Corrupt Leaders', description:" The rulers of this region were even more corrupt than is usual for those in their position, trading the wealth and lives of their subjects for their own selfish purposes. They may have been so absorbed in exploiting the locals that the actual business of rule was taken over by outside parties, whether corporations, gangs, or local brotherhoods."},
  DefensiveWar:{name: 'Defensive War', description:" The region was invaded by a hostile outside power, be it a neighboring government, an organized militant group, or an aggressive megacorp. The damage the conflict caused is yet visible in the region, whether or not the invaders were successful it taking control of the place."},
  EconomicCollapse:{name: 'Economic Collapse', description:" The region was reasonably prosperous until some twist of global politics or local economic disaster plunged them into poverty. Their major industries were lost, their people left to toil in desperate exploitation, and the few green shoots of present prosperity are threatened by powers that prefer the region's current impoverishment. Numerous small local organizations and brotherhoods have sprung up to give the locals some means of survival."},
  Famine:{name: 'Famine', description:" Hunger has scourged the region in the recent past. Local food sources failed and some collection of events made it impossible to bring in adequate supplies from elsewhere. Many of the poorest denizens starved, and those that couldn't flee to other places were left to make whatever bargains they had to make in order to get their daily soy. Food supplies in the present day are likely under the tight control of whatever authorities rule here."},
  Uprising:{name: 'Uprising', description:" The region experienced an outburst of violence from a particular group or social class, one that caused substantial damage before it was quelled. The survivors likely nurse a grudge still, and the local government and megacorps are trying to stamp out the last embers of this resistance. The rising was likely triggered by some exceptionally intolerable offense, or the group may have been gradually accumulating enough success and influence that it no longer accepted its former subordinate state."},

export const DistrictTrait ={
  AbjectDespair:{name: "Abject Despair",description:"This district has been utterly and mercilessly exploited by others in the city, its inhabitants denied all but the most vital public services and used purely for their value as disposable labor and entertainment. The locals no longer have any hope for anything better, and most seek only to escape their misery in drugs, VR, or violence."},
  AnnexedDistrict:{name: "Annexed District",description:"A significant part of the district used to be an independent city or town with its own officials and government. At some time in living memory, the city annexed it, with or without its consent, and the former rulers still seethe with resentment, perhaps retaining certain secrets about the place."},
  ArtScene:{name: "Art Scene",description:"The district has at least one powerful artistic movement active in it. The medium may be sculpture, music, graffiti, biomods, or anything else that speaks to an aesthetic, but everyone knows that it's where the ambitious young artists seek recognition and glory. Anything that can be monetized will also draw corp attention."},
  BeastInfestation:{name: "Beast Infestation",description:"A particular type of dangerous animal or vermin infests the district, perhaps having escaped from a local laboratory, having been cultivated as guard animals by local gangs, or having found something particularly appealing about the local industrial sites. These creatures are usually hostile and hungry, and the locals have to take steps to protect themselves."},
  BlockadedStreets:{name: "Blockaded Streets",description:"It's very difficult to move freely in this district, as numerous roads and neighborhoods have been blockaded by gangs or city officials due to outside raids, local disorder, or simple profit-making opportunities. Bribes or “tolls” are needed to bypass these blockages, or else local connections may be required."},
  BorderDispute:{name: "Border Dispute",description:"The district's power structure is under siege by rivals who are trying to carve off the better pieces for their own jurisdiction. The fight may be waged in the city's administration or it may be a matter of criminal and gang clashes."},
  CanalDistrict:{name: "Canal District",description:"Where other districts have streets, this one has waterways. It may be the product of never-corrected flooding, a seacoast geography, or a city improvement plan gone awry, but the locals have gotten used to getting around in small boats. Aquatic cyber is relatively common here."},
  CorpOutpost:{name: "Corp Outpost",description:"A corporation that doesn't otherwise have much influence in the city has an outpost here, one too important to the locals for the other corps to pry it loose. They may be providing goods and services more cheaply than the local corps can, or be in a tenuous alliance with some city power that finds their presence useful."},
  CorpStronghold:{name: "Corp Stronghold",description:"One particular corp holds de facto rule over the district, with the municipal officials totally supine. Other corps might have small retail outlets for their products, but the ruling corp has the ability to keep all but the most minor of outsider influences off of their turf. The regional headquarters for the corp may well be in the district."},
  CorruptKingpin:{name: "Corrupt Kingpin",description:"A particular gang boss, city official, or corporate executive is the unofficial king of this district. Nothing major happens without their approval, and their approval is very expensive. Other power centers in the district exist only as minions to the kingpin or as aspiring usurpers,and the latter seldom live long."},
  CrazedGangers:{name: "Crazed Gangers",description:"Most gangs are at least slightly bizarre in their rites and customs, but the gang powers here are absolutely insane. They take their particular obsessions to unprofitable extremes, being driven by a demented religion, lunatic ideology, or absurd dictate of fashion. Their leaders may be fully aware of the irrationality of their chosen life, but be too nihilistic or privately profiting by it to abandon their path."},
  DarkMarket:{name: "Dark Market ",description:"The district is known for one or more black market zones where numerous illicit goods and services can be procured by outsiders. Most of these markets have a protector in some city official or corp executive, who can be expected to profit by the market's continuing existence."},
  DepthsBelow:{name: "Depths Below",description:"A significant portion of the district is subterranean, the locals having repurposed old infrastructure tunnels, mineshafts, or subterranean buildings for their own purposes. Most such underways are under the control of gang bosses, local chieftains, and others indisposed to legal forms."},
  ExtremeViolence:{name: "Extreme Violence ",description:"Most districts see regular gunfire among their lower classes, but this place takes it to a bloody extreme. Only the suicidal go about without visible weaponry, and entire blocks may be no-go zones for anyone not in a well-armed group. The locals may profit from this reputation, earning a premium as thugs or assassins, or some outside power may find profit in keeping the blood flowing."},
  GangWarfare:{name: "Gang Warfare",description:"All but the most tightly-controlled districts have some level of gang conflict, but the level of violence here is unsustainably high. Something has provoked a savage degree of struggle here and it's not going to end until the question is resolved, the corps move in with heavy firepower, or one participant emerges victorious."},
  Gentrification:{name: "Gentrification ",description:"Something has changed recently, and the district is receiving in influx of new inhabitants who are richer or better-connected. Longtime local powers are being deposed in favor of new money, and their clients are losing their support. Existing resources of land or economic opportunity are being seized by the newcomers, who likely share a corporate background or cultural identity."},
  GoodTimes:{name: "Good Times",description:"Things are actually pretty good in this district. Whether by chance or design, the local economy is strong enough to give people hope of upward advancement and the local streets are unusually safe. These good times can easily provoke restiveness among the populace, however, as they move to strike violently against anything that threatens their prosperity."},
  GrandStructure:{name: "Grand Structure ",description:"Some massive human construction dominates the district, be it a vast bridge, looming tower, crumbling arcology, or huge excavation. If the structure is still functional, most of the “legitimate” locals earn their living working on it. Other structures may be ruined, abandoned, or being fought over by the corps."},
  HeavyChrome:{name: "Heavy Chrome",description:"Cyberware is unusually common in this district. It may be necessary for the local industrial workers, or it may be offered as blemished seconds by a corporate outlet, or the local culture may find it very important to be chromed. Numerous cyberdocs and clinics can be found here, though the low-end ones may be fit only for the poorest and most desperate buyers."},
  HighMutation:{name: "High Mutation",description:"Long-time locals are prone to one or more physical stigmata produced by the local environment. It may be a legacy of a chemical spill, pathogen release, a heritable cyber-induced genetic malfunction, or some other persistent cause. These marks may be consistent, or the locals might all exhibit them in their own way."},
  HighlyFashionable:{name: "Highly Fashionable",description:"For whatever reason, this district is now the place to see and be seen in the city. Celebrities and officials have made it their second home, with clubs and other institutions springing up to cater to the fashionable upper class. Even shabby lodgings go for premium rates, and many of the locals are eager to profit while the vogue lasts."},
  HumanTrade:{name: "Human Trade",description:"People are bought and sold here, perhaps openly and perhaps under the rubric of “training indentures” or “debt repayment plans”. Most of the major powers here are involved in this human trafficking, and other city inhabitants know that the easiest place to get “workers” is in this district."},
  ImmigrantGhetto:{name: "Immigrant Ghetto",description:" A chunk of the district is occupied by immigrants from outside the city. Some such zones are mono-ethnic, while others are simply dumping grounds for the desperate, foolish, or optimistic who have come in search of work or success. These ghettos are usually minimally policed, order being maintained by ethnic gangs or the human traffickers who bring the newcomers."},
  ImpendingDoom:{name: "Impending Doom",description:"The district's main industry is about to die, its criminal kingpin is on his deathbed, two equally-powerful gangs are about to go to war, or some other rapidly-approaching reckoning threatens to throw the district into chaos. Everyone knows it's going to happen soon, and everyone's trying to make the friends and settle the scores necessary to survive it."},
  IndustrialWasteland:{name: "Industrial Wasteland",description:"This district is not well-suited for actual human habitation. Massive zones of automated industrial machinery extract some necessary resource or manufacture some product, and the limited number of people needed to operate the machines live in well-delineated habitable zones. The rest of the area may be difficult or very dangerous to physically access."},
  LastingScar:{name: "Lasting Scar",description:"Something went terribly wrong here in the past, and the district still hasn't recovered. Massive riots, a huge industrial accident, the wreckage of urban warfare, a natural disaster that smashed major structures, or some other calamity has left its mark. Locals have to either work around the remnants or somehow profit by looting them."},
  LocalSpirit:{name: "Local Spirit",description:"The natives of the district are acutely aware of their origins and tend to band together to exclude outsiders. They may have deep local divides, but few wish to involve external forces, and they have as little to do with city officials and corp outsiders as possible. Only through extensive favors and contacts can this distance be removed."},
  LostGlory:{name: "Lost Glory",description:"Things used to be better than they are now. Maybe the locals were richer, the location was more important, or the district had some critical function the rest of the city relied on. Those days are gone, now, and only remnants and relics of past success remain."},
  LuxuryHaven:{name: "Luxury Haven ",description:"This district may have its bad spots, but at least some of it is dedicated to the golden serenity of extremely wealthy or important people in the city. In these enclaves, the streets are safe, the shops are all high-end, and the security is omnipresent. Getting in or out of these zones usually requires the right passes or connections."},
  MalcontentLocals:{name: "Malcontent Locals",description:"The district's locals have been a substantial annoyance to the city government and its ruling megacorps. Riots, sabotage, illicit broadcasts, and prohibited net usage are common here, with the natives either holding a bitter grudge against the city's rulers or finding it profitable to oppose them. Their leaders may be bankrolled by outside enemies of the city's rulers."},
  MediaFactory:{name: "Media Factory",description:"Entertainment is produced in this district, with a host of VR producers, video creators, “journalists”, and other media types clustering in the area. Actors of every description hunt for their next role, and the local media corps grind them up monthly to make their necessary quota of corporate-approved media product."},
  OldCapital:{name: "Old Capital",description:"This district was once the heart of the city, the center of its government and the headquarters of major powers. Some past event made the place unsuitable for that, but old government facilities and abandoned institutional structures still litter the place. Not everything of value was removed from these places at the time of the shift."},
  OpenParkland:{name: "Open Parkland",description:"A significant part of the district is an open park, with near-wilderness conditions in some of it due to long neglect and intentional dilapidation. The overgrown terrain makes it very easy to hide in the park, and numerous illicit enterprises have camps or delvings within its bounds."},
  OrbitalLink:{name: "Orbital Link",description:"The district has or supports a spaceport. If your setting has orbital habitats, the rich and powerful flow through on their way to their heavenly palaces. If not, the spaceport may be launching satellites or industrial hardware for space resource exploitation. Numerous highly-educated workers live here, and exceedingly expensive hardware can be found here as well."},
  Organleggers:{name: "Organleggers",description:"A number of very influential organlegging rings operate out of the district, buying cyber and flesh from gangs throughout the city. Those who desperately need certain implants or surplus organs that can't be obtained legitimately can be found dealing with ring representatives here, as well as medical organizations who aren't picky about their sourcing."},
  OutsiderEnclave:{name: "Outsider Enclave",description:"A significant chunk of this district is under the administration or control of an outside power, whether a rival city, neighboring nation, or outside corporation. It may be a remnant of a prior war, corporate takeover, city secessionists, or sheer governmental indifference. Laws inside the enclave may not match others in the city, and access in or out may hinge on diplomatic connections or useful smuggling ties."},
  PainfulProfits:{name: "Painful Profits",description:"There's significant money to be made here in some trade that harms or kills its workers and the local inhabitants. A dangerous mine, a toxic factory complex, organized blood sport arenas, an old dump that can be scavenged, or some other site is both providing the bulk of the local paychecks and a good chunk of the fatalities as well."},
  ReligiousCenter:{name: "Religious Center",description:"There's a church, holy site, pilgrimage place, or venerated school here dedicated to a particular religion. Many of the locals are committed believers, and they have ties with fellow faithful outside the city. The secular authorities always have to keep the opinions of religious leaders in mind, and bribery or threats to them are not unknown."},
  RestiveLocals:{name: "Restive Locals",description:"The district natives are in a ferment, liable to explode into riots or demonstrations at the slightest provocation. Some ongoing problem or determined agitator is whipping the locals up, and things can get explosively out of hand on short notice. Certain powers might be trying to take advantage of that."},
  RestrictedAccess:{name: "Restricted Access",description:"People are not allowed to enter or leave the district freely. The locals might be second-class citizens, they might be too important to risk outside intruders, or they might be too troublesome to risk letting them wander. Only those with the necessary passes and justified business are allowed in or out."},
  Secessionists:{name: "Secessionists",description:"A portion of this district flatly refuses to recognize any outside authority. It may be too impoverished and useless to invite any opposition from the municipal government, or the local corps may have not finished deciding which of them should take it over. In the meanwhile, the locals may or may not have come together behind a single local government."},
  ShiftingTrait:{name: "Shifting Trait",description:"Roll twice on this table; the first trait is ending here, but whatever force or circumstance is ending it is also giving birth to the second trait. The old powers are unlikely to go quietly as the new influencers arrive."},
  SmugglerDen:{name: "Smuggler's Den",description:"The district's economy relies heavily on illicit transport of goods, sliding them past corporate import taxes or monopolies. A maze of smuggler's tunnels likely honeycombs the place, and seaside districts will have myriad hidden docks for small boats and stealthed submersibles."},
  SweatshopLabor:{name: "Sweatshop Labor",description:"Factory work is rarely safe and decently-paid. Here, it's nominally worse than slave labor, because slaves expect to be fed. Some massive factory or other economic enterprise is eating up poor laborers, wringing what work they can from them before leaving them broken and discarded. Most hold out hopes of decent pay and advancement, making good on it only often enough to keep the dream alive."},
  TombDistrict:{name: "Tomb District",description:"Some recent military conflict, natural disaster, plague, or other catastrophe killed an enormous number of people here. Some abandoned structures may still be full of the dead, while mass graves, memorials, or catacombs might contain other corpses. Criminal groups find considerable use for these unpeopled places."},
  TransportNexus:{name: "Transport Nexus",description:"A major port, airport, cargo hub, or transfer station serves as a major employer in the district, and influences from far-distant cities are common. Numerous not-entirely-licit immigrants and strangers can be found here."},
  UrbanMaze:{name: "Urban Maze",description:"The district's geography and architecture have made the place into a near-impenetrable maze of alleys, corridors, courtyards, and tenements. Without a local guide only the most well-known landmarks are accessible to outsiders, and it may be difficult to get vehicles bigger than a motorcycle into the area."},
  UtilityLack:{name: "Utility Lack",description:"Some critical public resource is very difficult to obtain in the district. The water supply may be limited, the power lines might not be accessible, or the public network may be down. Those who control access to these resources have power here, and much residential conflict involves obtaining these necessities."},
  ViceDens:{name: "Vice Dens",description:"This district offers services too repugnant or degrading to be welcomed by its neighbors. Entire subcultures may have formed around facilitating sins that aren't even physically possible without VR headsets or specific cyber implants. Other citizens might despise this district, but they do enough business to draw large amounts of money here."},
  VitalResource:{name: "Vital Resource",description:"The district provides some critical resource to the rest of the city. It may have the city desalinization plant, the primary power generation facility, or the core of the urban network. The most important locals are those in charge of this resource, and most of the rest make their living off of maintaining it or selling it to the rest of the city."},
